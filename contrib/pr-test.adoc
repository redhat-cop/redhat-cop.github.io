= Testing a Pull Request

Here we walk through the process contributors should follow when testing open _Pull Requests_.

== Testing a Single Pull Request

First thing you need to do is set up the Pull Request author's fork as a _remote_ in your local repository.

[source,bash]
----
git remote add oybed git@github.com:oybed/casl-ansible.git
----

Then fetch the latest changes from that remote

[source,bash]
----
$ git fetch oybed
remote: Counting objects: 298, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (58/58), done.
remote: Total 298 (delta 163), reused 213 (delta 153), pack-reused 75
Receiving objects: 100% (298/298), 38.23 KiB | 1.53 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (173/173), completed with 56 local objects.

 * [new branch]      docker-39      -> oybed/docker-39
...

Then check out the branch containing the Pull Request Changes.

[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout oybed/docker-39
----

At this point, you have 

Check out the branch that represents _your_ Pull Request
[source,bash]
----
git checkout gcp-3.9
----

Then _rebase_ your branch on top of the other Pull Request's branch:
[source,bash]
----
git rebase oybed/docker-39
